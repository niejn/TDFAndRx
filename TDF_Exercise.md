# Car Washing Workshop

in this exercise you'll build a simulator for a car washing company.
The car washin process is build from 5 stations
1. Car acceptence - attaches an ID to each car
2. Auto wash - Takes 5 seconds of processing time
3. Manual wash - Takes 6 seconds of processing time
4. Wash QA - determines randomly if a car needs to go into the process again

## Constraints
* When a car is checked-in, it specifies if it wishes to do an Auto+Manual wash, or just manual.
* There are only 3 Auto-wash machines
* There are only 2 Manual-wash employees
* QA can only check 2 cars at once
